# General guidance 

* Start with a sample template. If VA Notify has an existing template that fits your notification type, always use the template. If you want to suggest changes to an existing template, 
* Follow the VA content style guide. Email and text notifications should use plain language and follow our VA style guide wherever possible. This includes addressing the recipient as “you” and using “we” to refer to VA. 
* Avoid PII/PHI—and always get approval of new or updated notifications from a privacy officer. Email and text notifications are not secure, so we can’t include recipients’ personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI). The only exception is if a recipient has opted in to receive PII/PHI in their notifications and a VA privacy officer has approved the specific use of PII/PHI — but there may be additional requirements for how you can include this.

## Email notifications

### Subject line 

* Aim for no more than 9 words and 60 characters in subject lines
* If the goal of the email is to prompt the Veteran to take an action, make the subject line a CTA starting with an action verb
    * Like this: Review your dependent information for VA benefits
* If it's a reminder or confirmation email, make the subject line a short phrase or statement
    * Like this: VA appointment reminder 
    * Like this: We've received your application for burial benefits 
* If it's a post-submission failure notification (part of the zero silent failures initiative), consider adding "Action needed" to the subject line to make it clear that there's an urgent need
    * Like this: Action needed: We couldn't process your VA form

### Salutation 

Personalize the email with the salutation “Dear ((first_name)),” 

#### Closing and sign-off 

Use the general closing "Thank you" on its own line with no punctuation. We don't need to add attribution to "VA.gov" or "the VA team." 
Note: Don't say "Thank you for your service" in the closing or anywhere in the email. Research has found that some Veterans may have negative feelings about this phrase. 

#### Header levels 

* VA Notify supports header levels 1, 2, and 3
* H1 should be either exactly the same as the subject line, or a slightly longer and more detailed version of the subject line (for example, using "VA form" in subject line and "disability claim form" in H1, to keep subject line in character limits)

#### Feature card (block quote card)

* Use the card component to display important information, like confirmation numbers or the date of an upcoming appointment.
* If the feature card displays information from an online form confirmation screen, try to use the same field labels in both (like "Date submitted")

#### Links 

* Follow general VA guidance for writing link text
* And follow these specific rules for links in emails:
    * Always include a destination like "on VA.gov" in link text, since we always need to specify the destination when linking from an email 
    * [add don’ts here]
    * Like this: Pay your copay bill on VA.gov
* Use the analytics link generator with UTM parameters for tracking purposes
* Limit the number of links — use a primary call to action. Don’t overload the email with links to more info.

#### Footer 

* Use the footer to explain why we sent this email to this specific person:
    * Like this: You’re receiving this email because you submitted a form on [VA.gov](https://wwww.va.gov). Don’t reply to this email.
* Footer appears below a horizontal line in VA Notify email templates.
