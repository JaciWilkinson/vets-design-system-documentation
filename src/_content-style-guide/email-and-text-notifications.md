# Email and text notifications

All email and text notifications we send to Veterans should be trustworthy, actionable, and easy to understand. 

## General guidance for notifications
* **Start with a sample template.** The VA Notify system provides several sample templates for common notification types. Try to use as much of the sample template content as possible, for consistency across notifications.
* **Follow our content style guide.** Email and text notifications should use plain language and follow our VA style guide wherever possible. This includes addressing the recipient as “you” and using “we” to refer to VA. [Review our top 10 plain language standards](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/plain-language/#top-10-va-plain-language-standards)
* **Protect Veterans' personal information.** Always get approval of new or updated notifications from a VA privacy officer. Email and text notifications are not secure, so we can’t include Veterans’ personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI). 
**Note:** Privacy officers may allow exceptions to the PII/PHI rule when a Veteran opts in to receive PII/PHI in their notifications. You must work closely with the privacy office and get specific approval for any notifications that include PII/PHI.

## Email notifications

### Subject line 

* Aim for no more than 9 words and 60 characters in subject lines
* If the goal of the email is to prompt the Veteran to take an action, make the subject line a CTA starting with an action verb
    * Like this: Review your dependent information for VA benefits
* If it's a reminder or confirmation email, make the subject line a short phrase or statement
    * Like this: VA appointment reminder 
    * Like this: We've received your VA form 
* If it's a post-submission failure notification (part of the zero silent failures initiative), start the subject line with "Action needed"
    * Like this: Action needed: We couldn't process your VA form

**Note:** For digital forms, get guidance on submission notification emails and templates in the Pattern section of the design system. [Form submission status pattern](https://design.va.gov/patterns/help-users-to/stay-informed-of-their-application-status) 

### Salutation 

* Personalize the email with the Veteran's first name in the salutation as “Dear ((first_name)),”
* Don't include the Veteran's last name

#### Closing and sign-off 

* In most emails to Veterans, you don't need to add a closing line — in VA Notify, the standard template header the sender address will identify U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs as the sender
* Don't sign off as "VA.gov" or "VA" or "the VA team"
* Don't say "Thank you for your service" in the closing or anywhere else in the email (research has found that some Veterans may have negative feelings about this phrase) 

#### Header levels 

* VA Notify supports header levels 1, 2, and 3
* H1 should be either exactly the same as the subject line, or a slightly longer and more detailed version of the subject line (for example, using "VA form" in subject line and "disability claim form" in H1, to keep subject line in character limits)

#### Feature card (also called block quote card)

* Use the card component to display important information, like confirmation numbers or the date of an upcoming appointment
* If the feature card displays information from an online form confirmation screen, try to use the same data field labels in both (like "Date submitted")

#### Links 

* [Follow general VA guidance for writing link text](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/links), including these rules:
    * Always include purpose and the destination in link text — for links to the VA website, add "on VA.gov" as the destination
    * **Like this:** Pay your copay bill on VA.gov
    * Put links on a separate line to help them stand out
    * Avoid “Click here,” since not all people are physically clicking links
    * Make links full sentences and avoid generic link text like “Learn more” and “Read more” by themselves
* If you're using VA Notify, use the analytics link generator for tracking
* Aim for no more than 3 links in a single email

#### Footer 

* Use the footer to explain why we sent this email and tell people not to reply:
    * **Like this:** You’re receiving this email because you submitted a form on [VA.gov](https://wwww.va.gov). Don’t reply to this email.
